# Protocols
## What Are Protocols?
Protocols are a set of rules that enable devices on a network to communicate.

# Key Protocols
## 1. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
TCP: Ensures reliable data delivery by breaking it into packets and confirming each arrives.
Analogy: Like a courier service that ensures every package is delivered and signed for.
IP: Handles addressing and routing packets to their correct destination.
Analogy: The address label on each package.
## 2. HTTP/HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol/Secure)
HTTP: Transmits web pages and data between a browser and a server.
HTTPS: Adds encryption using SSL/TLS for secure communication.
Analogy: A safe lock on HTTP to protect sensitive data.
## 3. DNS (Domain Name System)
Converts domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 142.250.191.206).
Analogy: The internetâ€™s phonebook.
## 4. FTP/SFTP (File Transfer Protocol/Secure File Transfer Protocol)
FTP: Used for transferring files between systems.
SFTP: Secure version of FTP using SSH for encryption.
## 5. SMTP/IMAP/POP3
Email protocols:
SMTP: Sends emails.
IMAP: Reads emails from a server.
POP3: Downloads emails to your device.
