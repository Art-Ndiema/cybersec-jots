# Network Security
This refers to the strategies, technologies, and practices designed to protect your network infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, or harm.

  # Firewalls
They block or allow traffic based on predefined security rules. 
It acts as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks like the internet.
We have different types : 
  - Packet-filtering firewalls: Check packets against rules.
  - Stateful firewalls: Monitor state of active connections.
  - Next-Gen firewalls: Include intrusion detection and prevention.

    # Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
They secure communication over public networks. 
It encrypts data sent between your device and the destination network.
Used in ; remote work, bypassing geo-restrictions

  # Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
  - IDS: Monitors and alerts when a threat is detected.
  - IPS: Takes action to block the threat in real time.

    # Wireshark
    - An amazing network Protocol Analyzer (Well, we are talking about Network Security so let us touch on a tool)
    - Well what can it do??
      - It can capture Live and offline Analysis
      - It can inspect looooots of protocols (I sure hope you know what a protocol is because thats a whole topic (Ok incase you don't know just know : PROTOCOLS - are a bunch of rules that must be followed to allow devices to communicate (Your device is actually doing it as you read this data that I typed from my device (As I am listening to a very annoying, but catchy song, by Toad Wars)))
      - It's multi-platform : meaning it runs on many operating systems (I will not tell you what an operating system is! If you don't know what it is I'll remember you in my prayers may Ada Lovelace and Barbbage save your doomed CPU (if you don't know what that is, you will make me cry)
      - Ooooh when Wireshrak captures your network data it can be browed on a GUI (Graphycally) (GUI makes me chuckle since it sounds like dog in my native language)
      - It can actually do VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) analysis (what is this? it's just converting voice signals into digital data packets)
      - Oooh coloring rules can be applied to the packet lists to help skim through our work = quick analysis
      - Once you are done and you want to export your data you can export it to XML, PostScript, CSV or even as plain text

    # Extra nuggets
    So I was going through Wireshark (I think its one of the World's best network protocol analyzers but I'll test it out for a long time to conclude on this, so far I've found no fault in it, so I'm putting it as number one) anyhow,
    did you know it was started in 1998 (I wasn't even born (I doubt my parents had even met))  


pssst cross your fingers I'll probably wire some more tomorrow this was fun.
